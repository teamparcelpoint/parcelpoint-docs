## Quickstart
Click and Collect Address is a two-step process, all which is done on the client side. The first step of the process is getting the ParcelPoint locations and their details and displaying them on the website for the user to choose from. Once the user has made their choice, the second step is to create a booking with ParcelPoint.  

### Step 1: Initialise the widget
The simplest way for you to allow customers to pick a ParcelPoint location for collection is with the ParcelPoint widget. It combines HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create an embedded list and map of all ParcelPoint store closest to the user's chosen location.

To see the widget in action, click the search bar and input one of the following:
* full or partial address (eg. 46 Kippax Street)
* town (eg. Surry Hills)
* city (eg. Sydney)
* postcode (eg. 2010)

To get started, add the following code to your checkout page:
```html
<!-- Add this <div> to the part of the page where you want to show the widget -->
<div id="parcelpoint-stores-widget"></div> 
```

```html
<!-- Add this script to load the widget -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://connect.parcelpoint.com.au/widget/v3.1/stores"></script>
```

```html
<!-- Add this script to initialise the widget -->
<script type="text/javascript">
    parcelpoint.Store.init({
        apiKey: "your-parcelpoint-api-key",
        initialAddress: '2000',
        targetDiv: "parcelpoint-stores-widget",
        storeType: "full",
        initialView: "map",
        selectFirstStore: true,
        yourLocationMarker: true,
        googleAPIKey: "your-google-api-key"
    });
    parcelpoint.Store.display();
</script>
```

Parameter | Type | Required | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`apiKey` | String | Yes | To get an `apiKey` you can [email us](mailto:requests@parcelpoint.com.au) to request one
`initialAddress` | String | Yes | The address you want the widget to select when loaded
`targetDiv` | String | Yes | The `id` of the parent element the widget will render inside
`initialView` | String | Yes | The default view type on load. Th view types are "map" and "list"
`selectFirstStore` | String | Yes | If `true` the nearest store to the `initialAddress` will be selected
`yourLocationMarker` | String | Yes | If `true` a pin will be dropped at the user's location on the map
`googleAPIKey` | String | Yes | This is needed to show the map on the widget.

An alternative to the widget demonstrated above is to implement a [custom integration](/ccaddress?id=custom-integration). The custom approach allows you to use any HTML element or JavaScript event to get the information needed from ParcelPoint to create a booking.

#### Custom styling
If youâ€™d prefer to have complete control over the look and feel of the ParcelPoint widget, you can overwrite our CSS with your own CSS file. 

### Step 2: Create a parcel booking
Once the user has selected a store they want their parcel to be delivered to, they will need to create a booking with ParcelPoint. To do this, the parcel must be ready for dispatch with the following information:
* `consignmentReference`
* `trackingLabel`
* `orderRef2`
* `autoConfirm: true`

**Important:** The parcel needs to have the status `AWAITING_ARRIVAL` for it to be created.

Using the endpoint below, when submitting your checkout form you will need compile a request body to be sent from the form.
