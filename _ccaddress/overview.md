## Overview
Click&Collect Address is a ParcelPoint service used by retailers to show all our ParcelPoint locations on their website for the user to choose as a collection location. 

> With Click&Collect Address, the courier is booked by the retailer and these details are included in the booking with ParcelPoint. 

Once ParcelPoint receives the booking, ParcelPoint will display the booking to the agent at the ParcelPoint location and they will mark the parcel as _Arrived_ when it comes into their store. The booking will also be displayed on the [Partner Portal](partner.parcelpoint.com.au) for the retailer to track the booking after delivery to the ParcelPoint location.

When the parcel arrives at the ParcelPoint location, the user will then be alerted by SMS and email of their delivery. The user will then visit the ParcelPoint location to pickup the parcel and the booking will be completed.

If the user doesn't pickup the parcel within 14 days of the parcel arriving at the ParcelPoint location, ParcelPoint will return the parcel to the retailer (retailer may incur a second charge for returning the item).
